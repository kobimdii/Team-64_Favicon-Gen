The only task assigned to me was to design the lofi wireframes of the landing pages for mobile, tablet and desktop which I did and was corrected and updated by the assistant lead Adebola.
Voluntarily I corrected some of the designed in terms of allignment, spacing and distorted images which I also communicated to the team lead.
I also voluntarily suggested a better way in which the forgot password page should be redesigned and designed an example screen which was a task given to Fisayo and that the image chosen for the forgot password should depict frustration instead of the one which was used and this observation was put into consideration and the forgot password screen was updated.
