I am Adeabyo Ganiu, a member of team 64 with student ID: I4G0003795EN
I was interviewed by a designer (Fisayo) and i shared my experience on several favicon sites. 
I worked on the sign up page of our web app
I implemented this design using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I worked on the design i was given and ensured it is functional and moble responsive.
