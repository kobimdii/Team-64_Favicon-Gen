# How to  download images on python(django)
My task on this involved researching on how to download the favicons(images), after the user uploaded whatever images, text or texticons, he/she wants to use.
My team agreed on using python, django to be presice. so after the research, I created the project and app in a virtualenv and updated the appropriate files to effect the download function. There's also a requirement.txt.
