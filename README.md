COLLABORATORS' GUIDE

Collaborators on this project are to use the Shared Respository Model. This model allows collaborators push access to a single shared repository but topic branches must be created when changes need to be made or features added.

This repository contains:
1) The main branch
(WARNING: Do not push to the main branch! Only the Master Merger(s) assigned by the team can do this, after pull request reviews on the Dev branches.)
2) Frontend-dev branch
All subsequent frontend branches created by collaborators will be merged here by the Master merger(s).
3) Backend-dev branch
All subsequent backend branches created by collaborators will be merged here by the Master merger(s).
4) Topic (Feature) branches
These branches are made by contributors for each feature, e.g. LogIn, SignUp, etc. 

Follow the steps below to collaborate here properly.

A] Clone the repo to your local machine.

To do this, run this command in your command prompt:
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/Team-64_Favicon-Gen

OR 

Open your code editor and choose "Clone Git Repository", then click on "Clone from GitHUb", and enter https://github.com/zuri-training/Team-64_Favicon-Gen.git to search for this repository. 
Next, open the cloned repository.

B] Create a new (feature/ topic) branch

First, run the â€“set-upstream switch. This informs your new branch of the remote repo to pull changes from to update your local repo.

To do this, run this command in your command prompt:
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/zuri-training/Team-64_Favicon-Gen

Secondly, switch to the appropriate dev branch i.e., Backend-Dev or Frontend-Dev.

To do this, run either of these commands in your command prompt:
$ git checkout Frontend-dev
OR
$ git checkout Backend-dev

Then, create a feature branch.

To do this, run this command in your command prompt:
git checkout -b branchname

Good!

C] Now, activate your virtual environment and install the project dependencies (in the requirements.txt file)

D] Work in your feature branch:

Add your codes to your feature branch

Stage the changes

Commit the changes with a clear commit message

E] Update from your upstream branch.

Right before you push your codes to your feature branch, check for any updates to the upstream branch. 

To do this, run this command in your command prompt:
git pull upstream Frontend-dev
OR
git pull upstream Backend-dev

(Check for any ensuing conflicts, resolve then, and commit the changes before you push)

F] Publish/ Push your branch.

Publish your feature branch and the committed changes.

To do this, run this command in your command prompt:
git push origin branchname

G] Make a Pull Request.

Move over to the GitHub repo, and create a Pull Request to the appropriate dev branch i.e., Frontend-dev or Backend-dev. Include the changes you made or feature you built in your topic branch, and tag the assigned Master Merger(s) to alert them for a review.
